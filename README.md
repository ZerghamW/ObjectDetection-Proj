# ObjectDetection Using Image Ai in Python

## What is ***Object Detection***?
> It is a *Computer Vision Technique* deals with
*   Detection of Different and Certain Classes in Images and Videos
*   Location and Manupilation of the occurences of these Objects and items.

**Beginning of the Object Detection Project**

- ***Pre-requistes***
    - Python
    - ImageAI Module with Basic Computer Vision Knowledge
    - Tensorflow
    - Keras
    - os Module

Following are the required liberaries for further working
Suggestion: Use Google Colab if you have a low-end device...

**Work only with Installing Required Liberaries for smooth running of ImageAI Module**

These are



*   Tensorflow 2.4.0
*   Tensorflow-gpu 2.4.0
*   Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Opencv, h5py, Scipy, Pillow

# Only Install these in Local Computer for VS Code, Jupyter, or PyCharm etc.

# Don't need to install on clouds like Kaggle and Google Colab etc.

`!pip install tensorflow==2.4.0`

`!pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.4.0`

`!pip install keras==2.4.3 numpy==1.19.3 pillow==7.0.0 scipy==1.4.1 h5py==2.10.0 matplotlib==3.3.2 opencv-python keras-resnet==0.2.0`


# Now installing Image AI

`!pip install imageai --upgrade`

It is important to create Some Directories. Thses include
- Input Directory
- Output Directory
- Model Directory where downloaded files for model remains
